In this SQL I am querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customers and orders.

#1. How many orders were places in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid) 
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 WHERE length(orderid) = 6 AND 
       orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an Iphone?
SELECT count(orderid) 
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 WHERE Product = 'IPhone' AND 
       length(orderid) = 6 AND 
       orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
  FROM BIT_DB.customers Cust
       INNER JOIN
       BIT_DB.febsales Feb ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderid
 WHERE length(orderid) = 6 AND 
       orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
Answer 1.
SELECT DISTINCT product,
                price
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 WHERE price IN (
           SELECT min(price) 
             FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
       );

Answer 2.
SELECT DISTINCT product,
                price
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 ORDER BY price ASC
 LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity) * price AS revenue,
       product
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln st, Seattle, WA 98101, How many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT sum(quantity),
       product,
       sum(quantity) * price AS revenue
  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
 WHERE location = '548 lincoln st, seattle, WA, 98101'
 GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(DISTINCT cust.acctnum),
       avg(quantity * price) 
  FROM bit_db.febsales Feb
       LEFT JOIN
       bit_db.customers cust ON feb.orderid = cust.order_id
 WHERE feb.quantity > 2 AND 
       length(orderid) = 6 AND 
       orderid <> 'Order ID';
